After independence some colonial settlers sold or gave up their land in fear of what would happen with the new government while others remained. the land sold by settlers was brought by govt and distributed to people under govt settlement scheme from Timau with approximately 20 to 17 Ac. the other lands were sold to co-operative and land selling lands with land being of approx 5 ac. The 5 acres dropped to 2.5 ac due to subdivision and inheritance and now the majority of the pieces are approx 1.7 ac. This are is majorly occupied by people from Nyeri and Meru. This area was majorly under Rain Fed Croplands. CETRAD had an initiative to start the growth of drought resistance crops, however after the project ended. people reverted to their original crops. Due to this issues people started undertaking drawing of water from rivers to their farms to supplement farming which increased from 1960 to 2000 by a major change. This area is an Agroecological zone 2-3. The demand for water for irrigation is increasing and hence the river system is under pressure. The water hydromete at Archers Post drooped from 9 cubic meters to 0.9 a significant drop due to large-scale farming.","Photo":"StopOvers-fd606ecb-5a7f-45d1-8d33-2873a6ed1f8c.jpg","Photo2":"StopOvers-451e13a4-5ae0-4afb-9a3e-81b41686f0f8.jpg","accuracy":0.0,"date":"2025-02-13","time":"09:37:41.000","mode":"Manual"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.210659229588856,0.060418073364048]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Name":"Wangui Investment Limited Ebori Farm","Description":"Maasai Land, conversion of Maasai, colonial land , this part of land settler decided they won't. move, this area was transformed to large scale farming of wheat and livestock . recently part of the farms are in green house farming for vegetables and flowers totaling to 1300 ha of land which utilize irrigation system. in 1995 CETRAD Began the sensitization to better utilize the water in. the area with a proposal for farms to have at least 90 days water  reservoir. The main challenge was  to small scale farmers who could not have the space for the reservoir, this led to fromation of WRUAs. This challenge brought up the use of ground water and surface water harvesting. Between 2013 and 2019 a food system study based on wheat, agro industrial system which are located in this area, the small scale house hold system which is for household use and local trading. The result of the study indicated that the small scale farmers produced the best results compared to the international food system. Agrochemicals, used in these large-scale farmer, 43 highly hazardous pesticide were found in use in Kenya, while 42 have been disallowed in Switzerland.","Photo":"StopOvers-b6b8b94b-f680-466f-be9f-ed5deb6a323e.jpg","Photo2":"StopOvers-c43aa39a-671b-40d6-b82f-86954a066f35.jpg","accuracy":0.0,"date":"2025-02-13","time":"10:38:52.000","mode":"Manual"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.346468774024373,0.088494523054663]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Name":"Nyambene Hills and Ridges","Description":"Nyambene, Abardares Ridges and Mt Kenya play a major role in Ewaso Nyiro North basi and Ewaso Nyiro River all through to Merti Aquifer, lake Ewaso where the river disappear. These water towers play vital roles in the low land areas. A study was undertaken which resulted to 58 high yielding spring covering Isiolo and Nyambene to make Isiolo nyambene system and 6 artesian wells in Ewaso basin. the study resulted to explanation that river Ewaso could dry up stream yet had water in lower area. Some of the spring are in threat of drying up(at least 50%) loss. This is due to encroachment and opening hill sides for crop production and settlement. A study done using satellite images on forest cover depletion has shown the alarming loss of forest, which in turn might be causing the loss of springs and wetlands. in addition, the privatization of the public land on water towers has led to loss of springs. This issue requires to be addressed, and we are planning to undertake a land restoration process. The community land act, forest act and national land commission, provide hope for reclamation of these communities and public lands.
